I am starting to feel it’s that for sure. Now mid 30’s I am starting to feel time go faster. In reflection I thought I would be in a different situation than where I’m at right now. Not that I’m unhappy by any means. Just, I’m sure everyone thinks when they were 10 years younger certain milestones or levels of success would of hit. Not that they haven’t either.</p><p>It’s just for me, something isn’t sitting right. I’m not happy with the potential I am letting slip by. It’s an active decision for me. To choose to relax because I “deserve it”, instead of learning or being productive. Indulging over discipline I feel I have slipped into.</p><p>Now that 2019 is coming I feel that it’s a great time to get piggybacking. I want to achieve some things in 2019 and will be using this blog to help me out in this regard. So what do I hope to achieve:</p><ol><li>No alcohol. Full stop, none. I don’t want it apart of my life anymore. I want to be productive and have meaningful relationships with people. I don’t want this liquid to jeopardize this. Too often do I feel like I am an enabler or needing an excuse to drink. It’s an easy devil to succumb to. It’s also a bad habit to get into. I feel like my productivity will skyrocket if I take this mind altering substance out of my circle of influence.</li></ol><p>I also think that by doing activities outside of going to the pub with friends will open up doors to create more solid relationships with people. Hopefully cementing in some new shared hobbies and opportunities with friends. So starting now. No alcohol for a year. Then I will reassess.</p><ol><li>I want to write a book. I’m in the software development industry and feel like I’ve taught many already. I want to write a book and self distribute this in 2019. I’m yet to decide the topic or how to go about writing this. But I feel this blog and that book will allow me to better express myself in written form. That and I get tangible output others can benefit from at the end of the project. I’ve written two chapters that got published before.</li><li>I really want to be less selfish and really develop a strong bond with my partner of coming up to 3 years. I feel like I need to be thinking less “me” and more “us”.</li><li>I want to get back into my routine of workouts. I used to put in 16 - 20 hours a week of intense workouts 6 years ago. I miss those times. For whatever reason those times were ones where I felt like I had the strongest self identity. So a routine will be built!</li></ol><p>There it is! Better health. Sharing knowledge and moving away from myself to others. The year of 2019 I hope will be the happiest and healthiest. I’m really looking forward to creating the discipline that these goals require and that this blog requires.</p></article></main><footer><p class="copy"><small>by someone.</small></p></footer></body></html>
