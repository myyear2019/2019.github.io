Here we are. Well last night, which was on Christmas evening I set up this blog. It’s pretty basic but it is all I need for right now.</p><h2 id="yoga">Yoga</h2><p>I did 30mins of Yoga last night. I found an online series, 30 days of Yoga. Which I found from here https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLui6Eyny-UzwxbWCWDbTzEwsZnnROBTIL It’s pretty intense. I find as she’s speaking you have to hold and wait for her to finish. Kind of interupts the breathing exercises she’s trying to promote. Alas, it is a beginners course and it will probably get less interrupted as it goes along.</p><h2 id="the-book">The Book</h2><p>I reached out to a friend who wrote a book. He gave me some pointers and resources on how to publish a book and get into the mindset. So I am checking that out. So far I’m thinking a book on unit testing practices with Swift. Not sure if it is enough for a full book, or if people would even read it. But could be worth while. Actually might even throw in Objective C into the mix. I mean people need to write tests for objective c if they have some old skool codebases. So yeah!</p><p>Overall I am liking this direction and focus. Only day two. So I’ll shut up for now…</p></article></main><footer><p class="copy"><small>by someone.</small></p></footer></body></html>
